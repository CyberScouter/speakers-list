    p As a member of the student parliament of my university, I realized how difficult it is to keep the minutes and follow the meeting at the same time.
    p At some point one of my fellow students came up with the idea of a virtual list of speakers on which the users can enter themselves and the chairperson can change the order and call up the next speaker.
    p So this project aims to provide a free web app for maintaining lists of speakers in meetings.
